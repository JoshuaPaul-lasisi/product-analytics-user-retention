### Metrics Definition

**FOCUS METRIC - North Star Metric**
Percentage of activated users who make a repeat purchase within 30 days of their first purchase.

This metric captures whether users derive enough value from their initial interaction to return and transact again. Repeat purchasing behavior is a stronger indicator of long-term product success than raw traffic or short-term engagement.

Daily or weekly activity is not used because e-commerce purchases are naturally not frequent and actions requiring high intent. Measuring a 30-day window gives a realistic perspective of repeat purchases.


**The Supporting Metrics**
1. Activation Rate
Percentage of users who complete at least one purchase after appearing in the dataset

2. Time to Second Purchase
Median number of days between a user's first and second purchase.

3. Purchase Frequency (30-day Window)
Average number of purchases made by activated users within 30 days of their first purchase

These describe how quickly users return and how frequently they transact after activation. This would then explain what and how the FOCUS metric changes.


**Avoided Metrics**
1. Total Revenue
WHile revenue is important, it can be influenced by a small number of high-spending users and that would mask poor retention among the majority of users. For this analysis, the focus is on repeat behavior instead of absolute sale volume.


This analysis prioritizes user retention and repeat purchasing behavior over surface-level growth metrics. The goal is identifying where users drop off after their first purchase and what product decisions could improve long-term engagement.
